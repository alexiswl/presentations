# Nanopore Overview
.pull-left[
.baby-bear[
## Pros:
Ultra-long reads.
Low-cost.
Large Community support
Quick library prep
]
]
.pull-right[
.baby-bear[
## Cons:
Low accuracy.
Low yield.
Systematic bias - homopolymers.
Sample Specific.

# Alignment algorithms
Initially limited, due to unique sequencing error parameters.

.baby-bear[
* LAST was the first best choice.
  + Still very useful for metagenomics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
* Bwa mem with optimised parameters.  
  + -ont2d option equivalent to "-k14 -W20 -r10 -A1 -B1 -O1 -E1 -L0"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
* Minimap2 with the map-ont option. 
  + Equivalent to "-k15"
]

---

# Flags and Tags
.small[
Each alignment have set flags and tags. 
This allows you to group reads/alignments based on certain conditions.  
* Flags provide a boolean value for a given condition - True/False.
  + *range: 0-255.*
  + *Boolean combinations for eight attributes.*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
* Tags can be optional and hold any type of information.
  + *int, boolean, string*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
* Many flags/tags are illumina-sequencing specific:
  + *paired end*
]
---

## Important tags to look at for nanopore sequencing
.pull-left[
.small[
* NM tags
  + The edit distance between alignment and sequence.
* MD tag 
  + Verbose version of the cg tag (CIGAR string) of an alignment
  + Provides SNP/indel information
  + Alignment only - no soft-clip/hard-clip information
  + Insertions are not recorded. Info  [here](https://github.com/vsbuffalo/devnotes/wiki/The-MD-Tag-in-BAM-Files)

.small[
* A CIGAR string
  + `3M1I3M2D2M4`  
* An MD string equivalent
  + `2MA3^AG4`  
* A CS tag (See next page)
  + `:2*AT+G:3-AG:4`

# The CS tag and MD tag
.pull-left[
.baby-bear[
* CS tag - verbose version of MD tag
  + Easier for parsing.
  + Relatively new.
  + MD tag still required for some parsers.
    + Pipe through `samtools calmd` prior to sorting.
]
]
.pull-right[
.baby-bear[
* CS tag example:
  + `:6-ata:10+gtc:4*at:3`
  + `:[0-9]+ is an identical block`
  + '-[ACTG]+ is a deletion`
  + '+[ACTG]+ is an insersion
  + '*XY' is a substitution with base X subsituted for base y.

# Alignments in Minimap2
.pull-left[
.baby-bear[
* .large[Supplementary alignments]:
  + Definition: A segment of the read which is (mostly) non overlapping the primary alignment that aligns to an alternative position in the genome.
  + Cases:
    * Structural variation.
    * Chimeric reads.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
]
]
.pull-right[
.baby-bear[
* .large[Secondary alignments]:
  + Definition: A segment of the read which provides an alternative alignment to the primary.
  + Cases:
    * Repeat regions of the genome.
    * Primary alignment may still span both flanks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
]

# Some alignment quirks.
Using pysam, I found a high ratio of discordant to concordant reads.
These supplementary alignments also overlap the primary read.

# Methylation

What is methylation, current approach to methlyation.

Nanopolish detect methylation.
Tombo - I look forward to trying this.


# Methylation with nanopore sequencing

Benefits, pros cons.

# Two main common assembler types:

* de-Bruijn graphs

* OLC - Overlap-layout-consensus

# Assembly lingo
.small[
* k-mer:
  + A sequence of length k.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
* Node:
  + A short sequence or k-mer within the assembly that can be linked to other sequences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
* Edges:
  + A link between two sequences that have evidence of overlap.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
* Graphs:
  + A visual representation of the sequence using edges and nodes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
]

# Assembly lingo 2

.pull-left[
* Contig:
  .small[
  + An unambiguous* contiguous assembled sequence of the genome.
  ]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
* Scaffold:
  .small[
  + A collection of contigs with known orientation.

# Assembly issues

.pull-left[
*Difficult*:
.small[
* Parallelisation is non-trivial.
* Non-linear complexity.
  + Each read is compared to each other read for overlaps.
* non-haploid genomes are troublesome.
]

.pull-right[
*Impossible where*:
.small[
* Repeat-length &gt;

### Assembly Approach 1: De-Bruijn graphs

.pull-left[
.small[
* Pronounced 'D-Brown'
  + .tiny[source unknown, and irrelevant fact]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
* k-mer based path to infer assembly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
* Genome:

* `k=5`

### Assembly Approach 1: De-Bruijn graphs

.pull-left[
.baby-bear[
**Pros**  
Fast! - complexities:
  + Space is `O(N)`
  + Build time is `O(N)`
]
]
.pull-right[
**Cons**  
.baby-bear[
* Can't resolve repeats well.
  + Bound by k-mer size. Always less than read-length.
* Difficulty with read-errors.
  + Exacerbated by PCR-amplification bias.
]]

## Assembly Approach 2: OLC.

.pull-left[
.baby-bear[
1. Build an overlap graph:
  + Locally align prefix of read X to suffix of read Y.
2. Convert overlap stretches into contigs.
3. Run a pileup consensus on the reads mapping to each contig.
]
]
.pull-right[
.center[&lt;img src="images/prefix_suffix.png", width="60%"&gt;]

## Assembly Approach 2: OLC.

.pull-left[
**Pros**
1. Less sensitive to sequencing errors.
2. Handles larger repeats
3. Low specificity can bubbles.
]
.pull-right[
**Cons**
1. Overlapping reads is slow.
  + Non-linear time complexity
  + `O(N^2); N=Num reads.`
2. Low specificity can cause graph errors.

# Incomplete assemblies.

.pull-left[
## Useful for:
* Gene quantification.
* SNP detection.

.pull-right[
## Work needed:
* Structural annotation.
* Structural translocations.
* Copy number variation.

## Assembly with long-read sequencing.

Long read platforms: .tiny[That I'm familiar with] 
 + 10X Chromium.
 
 + PacBio.
 
 + Nanopore.

## PacBio Circular Consensus sequencing.

.pull-left[
.baby-bear[
* Increases accuracy.  
* Minimal sequencing bias.  
* Insert length != Subread length.  
* Gold standard for de novo assemblies.
  + But expensive cost-per-base.

# 10X Chromium.
.pull-left[
.baby-bear[
* Illumina level accuracy&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
* Supernova optimised for human genomes&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
* Shortfall on highly repetitive genome sequences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
* Some regions - long stetches of short tandem  repeats still unsolvable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

## Nanopore sequencing .small[for large genomes.]
.pull-left[
## Pros
.baby-bear[
* Low capital cost.
* Ultra-long reads can scaffold Illumina sequences.
]
]
.pull-right[
## Cons
.baby-bear[
* Low accuracy requires lower alignment stringency =&gt; greater cpu-hours.
* Systematic bias provides issues with genomic assemblies.
* Best with hybrid approach.

# Real-world np assemblers

## Miniasm

Fast and dirty - OLC.
Little consensus done.

## Canu

Forked from Celera assembler - OLC.
CPU heavy - Human Genome ~ 60'000 cpu hours!

# A hybrid approach!

Unicycler:
.baby-bear[
* illumina-only 
  + **SPAdes** + custom overlap trimming &amp; bridging

* de-novo 
  + **miniasm** + **racon** polishing

* hybrid 
  + **miniasm** + **racon** on anchor contigs + bridging.
