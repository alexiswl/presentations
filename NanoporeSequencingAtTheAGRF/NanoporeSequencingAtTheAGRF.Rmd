## Nanopore Sequencing - PMI

.pull-left[
**Technical**
* Very long sequencing reads
* Single-molecule
* Real-time
* Portable
* Low accuracy
* Lower yields
]
.pull-right[
**Financial**
* Minimal start-up cost
* Cheap for small uses of data
* Relatively expensive per base
]

## AGRF PromethION in focus
---

# The PromethION!

Kit-9, sample sensitive, great N50!

## Bioinformatics is a bottleneck
* Lots and lots of files (>20M) <br>
* Few ways to do one thing, benchmarking needed. <br>
* Getting help and resources. <br>
* Denovo assemblies have always been really hard. <br>
* Portable bioinformatics is difficult.

## New methods for standard tasks
.pull-left[
.baby-bear[
**Basecalling**
* Not bcl2fastq.

**Data QC**
* Read length, yields, read quality
* Fastq *indicitive* of read quality.
]
]
.pull-right[
.baby-bear[
**Adapter trimming**
* Nanopore reads have adapters too.

**Alignment**
* Different parameter settings required.
]
]

---

## New methods for novel tasks
.pull-left[
.baby-bear[
**Assembly**
* Longer reads overcome repeat regions
* Longer contigs possible
* Lower accuracy means more coverage required.

**Structural variation**
* High-confidence alignments can resolve novel arrangements
]
]
.pull-right[
.baby-bear[
**Methylation**
* No bisulphite treatment required.
* PCR-prohibited

**Haplotyping**
* Overcome homogenous regions of the genome
* Creating ultra-long haplotypes
]
]

## Basecalling methods
### GPU & CPU.
* GPUs much faster. Dogfish current basecaller in PromethION.

* Different algorithms give slightly different results.

* Check out Ryan Wick's [base-calling comparison repo](https://github.com/rrwick/Basecalling-comparison)

## WUB
* Software package repository from ONT.
* Similar to pysam API.
* Handy plotting tools.

## Betaduck

* Package to tidy up and evaluate sequencing runs on PromethION Beta.
* Can be used on MinION datasets as well (make sure not to over-allocate resources on a laptop)

# Minimap2

* Current gold-standard aligner for ONT data.
* Make sure the index is an 'ont-index' when generating index.
* Alignments come with CS-string.

# The CS tag and MD tag
.pull-left[
.baby-bear[
* CS tag - verbose version of MD tag
  + Easier for parsing.
  + Relatively new.
  + MD tag still required for some parsers.
    + Pipe through `samtools calmd` prior to sorting.
]
]
.pull-right[
.baby-bear[
* CS tag example:
  + `:6-ata:10+gtc:4*at:3`
  + `:[0-9]+ is an identical block`
  + '-[ACTG]+ is a deletion`
  + '+[ACTG]+ is an insersion
  + '*XY' is a substitution with base X subsituted for base y.

# Nanopolish

Jared T. Simpson's [nanopolish](https://github.com/jts/nanopolish) uses signal-level (fast5) data to:
* Detecting methylation
* Calling SNP level variants
* Polishing genomes

---

# Tombo

**ONT's methylation caller.**

* Provides output of regions of significance
* Can be captured as a 'wiggle' file to be viewed in a genome browser.
