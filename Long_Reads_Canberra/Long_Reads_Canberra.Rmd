Notes:
What are the benefits of long reads.
With short read sequencing, haplotyping information can be conveyed as long as there's no homogeneity for 300 bps. This often means that a SNP on one exon cannot be determined to be linked to a SNP on another exon for a given individual.
Both ONT and PacBio offer single-molecule sequencing, the DNA is not amplified prior to entering the flowcell meaning additional modifications such as methylation can be detected with high coverage.
More commonly long-reads are known for resolving scaffolds for genome assembly. Short-reads simply cannot overcome repeat regions longer than their read-length.

If you put in crap you will get out crap. Long-read sequencing technology can still process short-reads without fail however this will cause issues with your yield and your base n50.

## Bioinformatics is a bottleneck

* Novel file types 
  + multi-fast5s
  + unaligned BAMs<br></br>
* Many ways to do one thing, benchmarking needed.<br></br>
* Getting help and resources, community still in development.<br></br>
* Denovo assemblies have always been really hard.<br></br>

???

Notes:

Bioinformatics seems to be a bit of an afterthought.
Raw data off each of the machines comes in a different format, meaning bioinformatics algorithms often need to be built from the ground up.
Denovo assemblies will remain really hard as labs try to complete tasks in the most cost-efficient way.

???

Class: ONT, PacBio

Notes: 

While the standard fastq format is still used, getting to fastqs is not trivial. For ONT, this involves running digital signal data through an RNN to convert into sequencing values. QC values are no longer using interop files or Q30 scores, but we want to look at read length, the yield of the data and the sequencing quality, which can be much more varied when using long-read sequencing platforms.

# Minimap2

Minimap2 is the standard aligner for ONT and PacBio genomic data.
It can also be used with short-reads as its significantly faster than bwa but seems to not be as impressive just yet.

# Nanopore sequencing

[<img src='images/ont_sequencing_thumbnail.jpg' width=80%>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUb1TZvMWsw)

???

DNA molecules are negatively charged, the DNA passes through a positively charged membrane and this results in change in current across the channel. Different nucleotides are different sizes and this results in difference changes in current levels. Any given current state is not the state of a single nucleotide but of around 5-6 nucleotides in a given pore at a given time, this leads to some complexion about determining a given sequence of bases.

# Nanopolish

Jared T. Simpson's [nanopolish](https://github.com/jts/nanopolish) uses signal-level (fast5) data to:

While fast5 data is clunky heavy and not user friendly, this doesn't mean you should throw it away, the squiggle information can be used in downstream information for methylation calling and polishing of alignments.

Our SMRT-LINK runs on a singularity container, an is an on-demand device.
So only running when we need it!
SMRTLINK and its associated command-line version offer scatter-gather algorithms for each of the different services that we offer. I plan to put a link up on a mini-tutorial of how to set up your own SMRTLINK portal.

# Subread vs CCS Read 

<img src='images/subread_to_ccs.png', width=60%>

???

The subread contains the smrtbell adapters, converting re-sequenced reads into a concensus single read. 
This increases the accuracy in the read with every additional cycle. Often with genomic DNA, only one cycle is completed. There exists a trade-off between accuracy and length.

Lima is a PacBio developed algorithm for converting subreads into concensus reads.

# Future steps

???

Like the rivalry between Microsoft and Apple, two different operating systems with different pros and cons have focused hard on overcoming their cons, essentially resulting in two products which are now close to identical. Nanopore are looking at reinventing the way the way they peform sequencing with their new R10 pore shown in the diagram here. This is expected to place accuracy into the 95-97% range with a reduction in systematic bias in homopolymer areas. Patience may be required before seeing the final result, will need an overhaul in the models used to generate the basecalling.

Targeted sequencing is also coming, using a crispr approach to ligate sequencing adapters onto the end of the target DNA.
