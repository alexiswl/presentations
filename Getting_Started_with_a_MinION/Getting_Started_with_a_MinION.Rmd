# Quality Control

Quantification.

Purity.

Distribution.

???

We take a three pronged approach to library preparation.
We want to make sure that the sample mass is sufficient to start the prep.
It's important that our sample is purely DNA or RNA with minimal salt concentration.
And that the sample is of the distribution that we expect.

# More is more (when using HMW)

A 1 µg starting input is standard protocol since 8kb at 1 µg ~ 0.2 pmol.
Reactions are based on the number of available ends.

==> a HMW library of 50 kb requries an input of 6 µg to achieve equal molarity.

???

Math equation goes here on picomol.

# 'Mix by pipetting'

Either don't mix by pipetting, or use wide-bore pipettes.

# Some further tips

Storing flowcells the right way. The will last longer.
Bubbles are very bad.

# Data analysis.

Basecalling, is computationally intensive, regardless of the algorithm.

You have a plethora of options, albacore, guppy and Metrichor.
For high-quality samples, straight to the HPC.
How do I place data on the HPC?

# Latest chemistry and flowcells

The latest chemistry and flowcells have shown some outstanding results.
Because of the shear size of data, I've posted the first few minutes of the run to AARNET storage that one can download and added in a README to understand the download. It's around about 1G of data and so
