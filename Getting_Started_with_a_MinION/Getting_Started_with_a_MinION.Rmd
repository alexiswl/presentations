# Quality Control

Quantification.

Purity.

Distribution.

???

We take a three pronged approach to library preparation.
We want to make sure that the sample mass is sufficient to start the prep.
It's important that our sample is purely DNA or RNA with minimal salt concentration.
And that the sample is of the distribution that we expect.

# More is more (when using HMW)

A 1 µg starting input is standard protocol since 8kb at 1 µg ~ 0.2 pmol.
Reactions throughout the library prep and sequencing are based on the number of available ends.

==> a HMW library of 50 kb requries an input of 6 µg to achieve equal molarity.

???


# 'Mix by pipetting'

Either don't mix by pipetting, or use wide-bore pipettes.

70% ethanol can be increased to 80% ethanol for bead-clean ups.

When using a high starting input, increase stringency on bead-clean ups (0.4X)

???

Great care should be taken throughout the library prep.
Mixing using regular pipette tips can damage a library.
Increasing stringency on bead cleanups can reduce the number of short fragements in a library.
When a high starting input is used with HMW, you will break more, so you need to clean more.

# Some further tips

* Storing flowcells the right way. The will last longer.
* Bubbles are very bad.

# What's in a fast5?

???

It is possible to run a nanopore sequencing device mulitple types without ever actually seeing the inside of a fast5.
For what a .bcl file is to Illumina, a .fast5 file is to nanopore. 
Other than the squiggle data as shown above, there are a few other metrics in the fast5 file that may be of interest.

# Basecalling: From .fast5 to .fastq.

Basecalling, is computationally intensive, regardless of the algorithm.

You have a plethora of options, albacore, guppy and Metrichor.
For high-quality yield, straight to the HPC.
How do I place data on the HPC?

# Latest chemistry and flowcells

The latest chemistry and flowcells have shown some outstanding results.
Because of the shear size of data, I've posted the first few minutes of the run to AARNET storage that one can download and added in a README to understand the download. It's around about 1G of data and so
