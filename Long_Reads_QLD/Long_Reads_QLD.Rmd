## Beyond Short Reads

.pull-left[
.large[Benefits]
* Long-range haplotyping.
* Methylation with single-molecule level sequencing.
* Scaffolding and genome assembly
* Resolving of large structural variations

.large[Platforms]
* ONT
* PacBio
* 10X*

Notes:
What are the benefits of long reads.
With short read sequencing, haplotyping information can be conveyed as long as there's no homogeneity for 300 bps. This often means that a SNP on one exon cannot be determined to be linked to a SNP on another exon for a given individual.
Both ONT and PacBio offer single-molecule sequencing, the DNA is not amplified prior to entering the flowcell meaning additional modifications such as methylation can be detected with high coverage.
More commonly long-reads are known for resolving scaffolds for genome assembly. Short-reads simply cannot overcome repeat regions longer than their read-length.

## Bioinformatics is a bottleneck
* Novel file types 
  + multi-fast5s
  + unaligned BAMs

* Many ways to do one thing, benchmarking needed.

* Getting help and resources, community still in development.

* Denovo assemblies have always been really hard.

???

Class: ALL

Notes:

Bioinformatics seems to be a bit of an afterthought.
Raw data off each of the machines comes in a different format, meaning bioinformatics algorithms often need to be built from the ground up.
Denovo assemblies will remain really hard as labs try to complete tasks in the most cost-efficient way.

## New methods for standard tasks
.pull-left[
.baby-bear[
**Basecalling**
* Signal to Base
* Local alignments

**Data QC**
* Read length, yields, read quality
* Fastq *indicitive* of read quality.
]
]
.pull-right[
.baby-bear[
**Adapter trimming**
* Nanopore reads have adapters too.
* PacBio reads can be one sequence repeated many times.

**Alignment**
* Different parameter settings required.
]
]

???

Class: ONT, PacBio

Notes: 

While the standard fastq format is still used, getting to fastqs is not trivial. For ONT, this involves running digital signal data through an RNN to convert into sequencing values. QC values are no longer using interop files or Q30 scores, but we want to look at read length, the yield of the data and the sequencing quality, which can be much more varied when using long-read sequencing platforms.

# Minimap2

* Current gold-standard aligner for ONT and PacBio genomic data.
* Make sure the index is an 'ont-index' or 'pacbio-index' when generating an index file.
* Alignments come with CS-string.

# The CS tag and MD tag
.pull-left[
.baby-bear[
* CS tag - verbose version of MD tag
  + Easier for parsing.
  + Relatively new.
  + MD tag still required for some parsers.
    + Pipe through `samtools calmd` prior to sorting.
]
]
.pull-right[
.baby-bear[
* CS tag example:
  + `:6-ata:10+gtc:4*at:3`
  + `:[0-9]+ is an identical block`
  + '-[ACTG]+ is a deletion`
  + '+[ACTG]+ is an insersion
  + '*XY' is a substitution with base X subsituted for base y.

Minimap2 is the standard aligner for ONT and PacBio genomic data.
It's extremely fast and has some useful output.

## Basecalling methods
### GPU & CPU.
* GPUs much faster. .small[Guppy 1.8.3 is the current basecalling version]

* Different algorithms give slightly different results.

* .small[Check out Ryan Wick's [base-calling comparison repo](https://github.com/rrwick/Basecalling-comparison)]

# Subread vs CCS Read 



???

The subread contains the smrtbell adapters, converting re-sequenced reads into a concensus single read. 
This increases the accuracy in the read with every additional cycle. Often with genomic DNA, only one cycle is completed. There exists a trade-off between accuracy and length.

Lima is a PacBio developed algorithm for converting subreads into concensus reads.
