# The Longranger pipeline.

An important note is that the bcl2fastq stage is separate from the standard illumina bcl2fastq.
The longranger mkfastq is essentially a wrapper aroudn bcl2fastq with a couple of tinkerings.

# Longranger align
BWA + 10X Lariat aligner
.pull-left[
Input: 
 + Fastq.<br>
~Run time: 
 + 24 hours.<br>
Output: 
 + Aligned BAM
 + Alignment QC stats

.pull-right[
Output bam tags:
.baby-bear[
* AS - Primary Alignment Score
* XS - Secondary Alignment Score
* TBC.

Takes about a day, what bam tag outputs are provided.
First pass alignment with BWA.
Second pass with the 10X lariat aligner.

# Lariat Aligner

Extra benefits
Uses primary and secondary alignments alongside information of the GEM tag to:
1. Boost confidence in the alignment score (AM)
2. Use alignments with the same molecular tag to align to  repeat regions (XS)
3. Overcome tandem duplications using GEM tag of secondary alignments (XT)

# Longranger wgs
Obtain SNP calling .small[GATK], phasing and SV information

Input: 
 + Fastq.
~ Run time: 
 + Three days .small[w. 250GB RAM and 16 cores]
Output:
 + List of structural variants in bed format.
 + BAM files with Phasing tags.
 + .loupe file.

# The Loupe file
~ 5Gb file.

Contains alignment information across the entire genome.
Similar to an IGV browser.

# Viewing your loupe-file

Live Demonstration on a HPC.

Steps:
1. Allocate a node (be greedy)
2. Copy all your .loupe files to a local space on the HPC node.
3. Start loupe.
4. ssh in (with binding) into that node.
