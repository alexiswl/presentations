# Single Cell Bioinformatics: Where to start

The number of packages is forever growing.
Some good guides to package sets are at:

[scrna-tools.org](scrna-tools.org)
[awesome single cell GitHub repo](https://github.com/seandavi/awesome-single-cell)

Today we'll go through three.

+ Monocle
+ Seurat
+ ScPipe
+ SIMLR

---

# Monocle

* Clustering and counting cells
* Constructing single-cell trajtories
* Differential expression between cell-types
* Differential expression between time-points of a single cell type

* Pseudotime tracking

[Paper]
[Repo]

???

Monocle was one of the first single-cell packages around.
It has a bulk of citations and provides a comprehensive list of tools.

Straight forward installation process, pulls UMI transcript count matrices out of cell ranger.
Monocle will also normalise the data.

Psuedotime - how far through a cell-fate has an individual cell gone through?
Appropriate use-case would be tracking the cell-fates throughout a developmental process.

# Seurat

* Discovery and exploration of cell types along with cell-filtering

* Generate QC metrics

* Easily imports 10X data.

* Can pass data into Monocle.

???

QC metrics include showing the number of UMI per cell barcode in violin plot.
The percentage of mitochondrial DNA (an indicator of dead/dying cells)
The number of genes per cell also in a violin plot.

Useful to assign cell-type to identify clusters as a secondary confirmation to Monocle.

# ScPipe

Testing for cell-outliers.

Another good QC metrics to use.

# SIMLR

* Visualisation
* Dimension reduction.
* De novo discovery of cell-types
*
